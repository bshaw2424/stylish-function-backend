# stylish-function-backend

About the project:
The project is a ficitious affilite blog. My goal was to learn how the front end and backend connect to
bring a single application together. Also to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript before I jumped into a framework such as React.js. Through my learning experience I was guided with online resources such as MDN Docs, W3schools, Udemy courses, and YouTube Tutorials. Other resources used was books.

Some road blocks I encountered and learned

- Getting a good grasp of RESTful HTTP routes / MVC design.
- Understanding how the routes connect with route parameters.
- One big learning experience that I had was understanding how to read error messages to fix bugs.
- Dealing with bots was an issued which lead me to researching and implementing Google Recaptcha V2.

My github account:
Backend code => https://www.github.com/bshaw2424/stylish-function-backend

The admin backend provides CRUD functionlity for articles, images, and messages sections for the front end.
